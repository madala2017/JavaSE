There are two ways by which we can take Java input from the user or from a file

. BufferedReader Class
. Scanner Class


BufferedReader

    . a simple class that is used to read a sequence of characters.
    . it has a simple function that reads a character another read which reads, an array of characters, and
        a read line function which reads a line.
    .



Scanner

    . it is an advanced version of BufferedReader which was added in later versions of Java
    . it can read formatted input
    . it has different functions for different types of data types
    . is much easier to read as we don't have to write throws as there is no exception thrown by it
    .
