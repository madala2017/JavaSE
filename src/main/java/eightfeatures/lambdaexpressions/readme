Lambda expression

. Lambda expression helps us to write our code in functional style.
. It provides a clear and concise way to implement SAM interface(Single Abstract Method) by using an expression.
. It is very useful in collection library in which it helps to iterate, filter and extract data


Functional Interface

. Lambda expression provides implementation of functional interface.
. An interface which has only one abstract method is called functional interface.
. Java provides an anotation @FunctionalInterface, which is used to declare an interface as functional interface.


Why use Lambda Expression :

. To provide the implementation of Functional interface.
. Less coding.
