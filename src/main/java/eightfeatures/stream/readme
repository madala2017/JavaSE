Java 8 Stream:

. Java provides a new additional package in Java 8 called java.util.stream
. This package consists of classes, interfaces and enum to allows functional-style operations on the elements
. You can use stream by importing java.util.stream package


Stream provides following features:

. Stream does not store elements
. It simply conveys elements from a source such as a data structure, an array, or an I/O channel, through a pipeline of computational operations.
. Stream is functional in nature
. Operations performed on a stream does not modify it's source
   -> For example, filtering a Stream obtained from a collection produces a new Stream without the filtered elements, rather than removing elements from the source collection.
. Stream is lazy and evaluates code only when required.
. The elements of a stream are only visited once during the life of a stream
. Like an Iterator, a new stream must be generated to revisit the same elements of the source.

You can use stream to filter, collect, print, and convert from one data structure to other etc

. stream allows you to collect your result in any various forms
. You can get you result as set, list or map and can perform manipulation on the elements
