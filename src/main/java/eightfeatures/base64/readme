Java Base64 Encode and Decode:

. Java provides a class Base64 to deal with encryption
. You can encrypt and decrypt your data by using provided methods
. You need to import java.util.Base64 in your source file to use its methods

This class provides three different encoders and decoders to encrypt information at each level
You can use these methods at the following levels:


Basic Encoding and Decoding:

. It uses the Base64 alphabet specified by Java in RFC 4648 and RFC 2045 for encoding and decoding operations
. The encoder does not add any line separator character
. The decoder rejects data that contains characters outside the base64 alphabet


URL and Filename Encoding and Decoding:

. It uses the Base64 alphabet specified by Java in RFC 4648 for encoding and decoding operations
. The encoder does not add any line separator character
. The decoder rejects data that contains characters outside the base64 alphabet


MIME:

. It uses the Base64 alphabet as specified in RFC 2045 for encoding and decoding operations
. The encoded output must be represented in lines of no more than 76 characters each and uses a carriage return '\r' followed immediately by a linefeed '\n' as the line separator
. No line separator is added to the end of the encoded output
. All line separators or other characters not found in the base64 alphabet table are ignored in decoding operation
