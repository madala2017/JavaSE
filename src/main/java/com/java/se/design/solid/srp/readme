Single Responsibility Principle

. States that there should never be more than one reason for a class to change
. This means that every class or similar structure in ones code should have only one job to do
. Everything in the class should be related to that single purpose
. It does not mean that your classes should only contain one method or property
. There can be a lot of members as long as they relate to the single responsibility
